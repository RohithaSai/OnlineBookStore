# Online Book Store

In this online book store project, I will show you how to build a full-stack (MEAN stack) Angular 14 + Node.js with a CRUD Application. The back-end server uses Node.js + Express for REST APIs and connects with MongoDB database, front-end side is an Angular App with HTTPClient.

We will build a full-stack Book Application in that:
- Book has title, description, author, pages,price .
- Admin can add, retrieve, update, delete Books.
- User can buy and return books
- There is a search box for finding Books by title.

### Node.js Server

cd node-express-server
node server.js
```
